# iNotes â€“ Swift Simulation of iOS Notes App

This is a simulated version of a basic Notes application written in Swift using an online compiler (SwiftFiddle). Since I currently use a Windows system, this project demonstrates iOS logic implementation without a Mac.

## Features:
- Add notes
- Delete notes
- View all notes

## Swift Code
The core logic is implemented using Swift classes, arrays, and print statements to simulate user interaction.

## Output Example
