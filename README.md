# iRoutine â€“ Daily Routine Planner (Swift Simulation)

This project simulates a **Daily Routine Planner App** using Swift. It was developed as a logic simulation on SwiftFiddle due to hardware limitations (Windows system). This app allows users to:

- Add daily tasks
- View their full routine
- Delete tasks after completing them

## Sample Tasks
- Wake up at 5:00 AM
- Exercise and fresh up
- Study Python/Data Science
- College / Internship work
- Resume building & job applications
- iOS Project development
- Sleep early

## Platform
This is a Swift-based simulation using `SwiftFiddle.com` to demonstrate mobile development logic without a physical Mac setup.
